Car Booking System:

We all often use the online car booking facility  to navigate from one place to another in our day to day life. This python based application is an effort to simulate the car booking system which we use in our daily lives. 


Main functionality of this  code:

1. Letting a user create a car ride booking and register himself
2. Storing logs and booking history
3. Searching a record within all the bookings
4. Updating car ride location and user information
5. Deleting a booking from the system
6. Seeing all the bookings with respective booking number




Python files:

1. car_appointment.py

This module implements the code to let a user register himself and make a car ride booking and apart from that, this module also facilitates storing logs and booking history.


2. car_booking.py

This module implements code to let a user search his booking and update his ride or information or delete his booking and account.


3. car_display.py

This module implements code to facilitate viewing all bookings made by clients with their respective booking numbers/ids.



Packages used

1. Tkinter package
PIP package to implement Graphical User Interface - GUI

2. SQL lite 
Package to implement simple in-disk database to store booking and client records without the need of any external server.



Technologies used

1. Python
The main programming language in which whole coding has been done.

2. SQL
Programming language to manage queries for database.


Concept used
 
1. OOP – Object Oriented Programming.
2. Modular programming



Extra Features

GUI – Graphical User Interface implementation



Minimum system requirements

Python 3  or  higher version  with PIP – Python Installer Package



Note

If the user tries to leave the form incomplete while entering information during booking, the system asks him to fill in that  missing entry before proceeding further.

For the user who cloning the file from github
When any user is cloning the the file from github then for execution of the program he must execute the car_appointment.py first and on the basis of that choices the operation will be preformed.



Future aspects and further scope of improvements

1. The system could be made more real time based application by adding features such as GPS synchronization and maps.
2. Security features such as user authentication and user authorization to address privacy concerns and user data protection could be implemented and added to the system.
